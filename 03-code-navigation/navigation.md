# Navigation

Purpose of this section is to show how to find things
& how to work with multiple files

* This might be a great opportunity to show pane splitting
* I can see mouseover definitions of stuff that's far away
in this file (or is defined in a separate file)
* Mouseover display of docstrings
* Automatic import management
* Status colors in file tabs (has error, has warning, new, etc.)
and outliner
  * We don't want to get too deep into github integration but I
    think it's totally fair to say that if it's set up, the
    environment will give you a TON of information readily
* Go to definition, peek definition
* Full project search
