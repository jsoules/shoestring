# shoestring

Minimal Python project for a SciWare presentation demonstrating various VSCode features, using a
toy model that manipulates string tokens. This is organized according to the features being
demonstrated, NOT standard package layout conventions.

* I think the base example probably does find and find-replace in strings, and handles
concatenation or building paragraphs.
  * We'll say up front that obviously you would use StringBuilder or other built-in
    Python tools for these tasks, that's not the point of this demonstration
* Need to find excuses to use conditionals & lots of syntax

* Alternative example: something that computes probabilities on dice rolls, a la
[AnyDice](https://anydice.com/)?
