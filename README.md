# Introduction to VS Code

This is a minimal Python project intended as a reference for a Simons Foundation SciWare
presentation demonstrating various VS Code features. The defined classes mainly manipulate
string tokens (hence the name).

Every section has brief documentation about the features demonstrated:

1. [Overview and Syntax Highlighting](./01-syntax-highlights/syntax-highlights.md)
2. [Code Linting](./02-code-linting/code-linting.md)
3. [Code Completion Features](./03-code-completion/code-completion.md)
4. [Code Navigation Tools](./04-code-navigation/navigation.md)
5. [Code Refactoring Tools](./05-refactoring-tools/refactoring.md)
