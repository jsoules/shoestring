# Code Completion Features

Purpose of this section is to demonstrate tab completion (and probably some code generation)

* Need a class with methods we can import
* Need a method that has a long variable name we don't want to type all the time (autocomplete)
* Snippets?
* Auto-generating docstrings?
* **Mayyyybe** something about automatically generating tests or other good snippets/templating examples?
