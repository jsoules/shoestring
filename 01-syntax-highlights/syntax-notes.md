# Syntax highlighting

Purpose of this section is to demonstrate syntax highlighting

Show two side-by-side screenshots:

* `without_syntax_highlighting.txt`
* `with_syntax_highlighting.py`

Show screenshot of:

* `markdown-example.md`

The errors vs warning, etc belongs in code-linting

## Does this belong here or in a different section?

* Walk them around the VSCode UI a little bit
  * I have an overview of the file in my scroll bar...
  * I can see sections that I've saved, that are changed since last save,
  * Changed since commit, etc.
