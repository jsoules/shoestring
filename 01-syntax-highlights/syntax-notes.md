# Syntax

* Purpose of this section is to demonstrate syntax highlighting
  * (in a couple different languages?)
  * Honestly, live editing of a Markdown file **is** pretty *compelling*.
* Comparison of a text file, a python file, ......
* Walk around the VSCode UI a little bit
  * I have an overview of the file in my scroll bar...
  * I can see sections that I've saved, that are changed since last save,
  * Changed since commit, etc.
* Probably introduce the little squiggles when you have a warning or error
  * Errors vs warnings vs... whatever the green one is
  * Introduce errors for malformed code
  * Introduce highlights for used/unused/unreachable code
* Introduce auto text alignment (when dealing with recognized file types)
