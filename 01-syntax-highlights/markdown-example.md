# Markdown example

* Markdown syntax is meant to be **human readable**
* With **syntax highlighting**, the source code is *even more* readable
* Easily identify syntax errors while typing. For example, try removing the space after the bullet.
* The following vscode extensions are recommended
  * yzhang.markdow
  * bierner.markdown-preview-github-styles
* `inline code` is nicely highlighted
