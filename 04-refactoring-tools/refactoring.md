# Refactoring tools

Chances to show ways that you can make large edits more confidently with an IDE
because it can apply changes intelligently, since it can parse the code and not
just do string manipulation

* Rename a poorly named function
* Rename a less-than-descriptive variable
* Extract a function from some repetitive code
* Comment/uncomment a selection
* Multi-line editing with ctrl-shift-arrowkeys (oh hey I can tidy up my equals signs)
